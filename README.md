# Hey! 👋

- 🏫 currently enrolled in Cloud Engineering at Alt School Africa
- 👨‍💻 blissfully cracking my head with Linux and Bash, and very soon the snake language 🐍
- 👌 open to collabs... I guess-ish, I'll bring the table cloth to the table
- ⚡ interests outside soft-tech: access to reliable energy and conserving life on land
- 🕵️ here's a philosophy of mine - "what isn't known is safe"
- 🧯 safety first, or third. See you when I see you...
