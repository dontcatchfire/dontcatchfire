# Hey! 👋

- 🏫 I'm going brain first into Cloud Engineering and trying to make DevOps my girlfriend 👩‍🦱
- 👨‍💻 Bashing around in Linux, Slytherin with Python... 🐍
- 👌 open to collabs... I'll bring the table cloth to the table
- ⚡ A sworn enemy of mine: inconsistent or unreliable power supply, f*cking hate the sh!t
- 🕵️ My philosophy but holds true - "what isn't known is safe"
- 🧯 safety first, or third. **Don't Catch Fire**. See you when I see you...
